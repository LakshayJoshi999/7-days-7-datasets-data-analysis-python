# Day 6 – IMDB Movie Reviews Analysis
## Text & Rating-Based Exploratory Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of a **7 Days | 7 Datasets** personal data analysis challenge using Python.

Day 6 focuses on analyzing **textual review data** alongside **numerical ratings** to better understand how users express opinions and sentiment in movie reviews.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset:** IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews  

The dataset contains movie reviews labeled with sentiment (positive/negative), which were used to derive rating-based insights for exploratory analysis.

---

## Objective
To analyze movie reviews by exploring rating distributions, textual patterns, and the relationship between review length and ratings, and to understand how qualitative and quantitative data complement each other.

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected IMDB review data
- Cleaned and standardized text data
- Derived rating groups from sentiment labels
- Analyzed rating distributions
- Explored review length patterns
- Compared language usage in high vs low-rated reviews
- Identified common words and textual trends

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Key Insights
- Ratings alone provide limited context without textual explanation.
- Reviews tend to be longer when users have strong opinions.
- High and low-rated reviews show distinct language patterns.
- Combining text and numeric analysis leads to more meaningful insights.

---

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the value of combining textual review data with ratings to better understand user sentiment. While ratings summarize opinions, review text provides context and nuance that numbers alone cannot capture.

Such approaches are valuable for platforms that rely on user feedback to improve recommendations, content quality, and user experience.
