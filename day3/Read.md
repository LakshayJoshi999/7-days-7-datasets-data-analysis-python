# Day 3 – Time Series Analysis
## Sales Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of a **7 Days – 7 Datasets** personal learning challenge focused on building strong data analytics fundamentals using Python.

Day 3 focuses on **time series analysis** to understand how sales performance changes over time and to identify seasonal and long-term patterns in business data.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset:** Sales Forecasting Dataset  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting  
- **File Used:** `train.csv`  

The dataset contains order-level sales information along with time, product, and regional attributes.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques and understand seasonal and long-term patterns in business data.

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected the sales dataset
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Converted order dates to datetime format
- Engineered time-based features (year, month, year-month)
- Aggregated sales data over time
- Performed time series visual analysis

---

## Analysis & Visualizations
The following analyses were performed:
- Sales trend over time using monthly aggregation
- Monthly sales seasonality analysis
- Category-wise sales trends across time
- Regional sales distribution

These visualizations help highlight growth patterns and seasonal behavior in the data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights how sales evolve over time and demonstrates the importance of time-based aggregation in business analytics. Identifying trends and seasonality provides valuable context for future forecasting and strategic decision-making.
