# Day 7 – World Happiness Report Analysis (2015–2023)

## Overview
This project is part of a **7 Days | 7 Datasets** personal data analysis challenge using Python.

Day 7 focuses on analyzing **global happiness trends** over time using the World Happiness Report dataset. The goal is to understand how economic, social, and health-related factors influence overall well-being across countries and regions from **2015 to 2023**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset:** Global Happiness Scores and Factors  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-happiness-scores-and-factors  

The dataset consists of **multiple CSV files**, each representing a different year. These files were combined into a single dataset after standardizing column names and structure.

---

## Objective
To analyze global happiness trends across multiple years and explore relationships between happiness scores and key socio-economic indicators such as GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and combined multiple yearly CSV files (2015–2023)
- Standardized column names across datasets
- Cleaned and filtered relevant features
- Analyzed global happiness trends over time
- Compared average happiness levels across regions
- Explored correlations between happiness and contributing factors
- Visualized insights using line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Key Insights
- Happiness levels vary significantly across regions and over time.
- GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy show strong positive relationships with happiness.
- Freedom to make life choices plays an important non-economic role in well-being.
- Happiness is dynamic and influenced by a combination of economic, social, and institutional factors.

---

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the importance of viewing happiness as a multi-dimensional and evolving concept rather than a static metric. By examining trends across several years, the project provides deeper insight into how societal well-being changes over time and what factors contribute most strongly to happiness at a global level.
