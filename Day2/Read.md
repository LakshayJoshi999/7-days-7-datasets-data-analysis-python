# Day 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Spotify Tracks & Audio Features

## Overview
This project is part of a **7 Days – 7 Datasets** personal learning challenge focused on strengthening core data analytics skills using Python.

Day 2 focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships within Spotify track data.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Spotify Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Kaggle Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets  
- **Files Used:** `artists.csv`, `tracks.csv`  
- **Domain:** Music / Streaming Analytics  

The datasets contain track-level audio features and artist-level information, allowing for a combined analysis through dataset merging.

---

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to:
- Explore the distribution of track popularity
- Understand relationships between audio features
- Compare categorical attributes such as explicit content
- Use visual exploration to identify meaningful patterns

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected both track and artist datasets
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates
- Merged track-level and artist-level data
- Resolved column name conflicts after merging
- Performed exploratory data analysis using visual techniques

---

## Visualizations Included
- Distribution of track popularity
- Popularity comparison for explicit vs non-explicit tracks
- Relationship between energy and danceability
- Correlation heatmap of audio features
- Interactive popularity distribution using Plotly

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly  

---

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that track popularity on Spotify is highly skewed and cannot be explained by a single audio feature.  
EDA proved essential in uncovering patterns, validating assumptions, and guiding further analysis.

---

## Notes
- Track popularity is used as a proxy metric for streaming performance.
- All datasets used are publicly available and intended for learning and portfolio purposes only.
