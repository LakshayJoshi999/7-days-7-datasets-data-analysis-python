# Data Cleaning – Chicago Food Inspections

## Project Overview
This notebook focuses on **data cleaning and data quality analysis** using the Chicago Food Inspections dataset.  
The objective is to identify common real-world data issues and apply systematic cleaning and validation techniques before performing any deeper analysis.

This project is part of a **7 Days – 7 Datasets** personal learning challenge using Python.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Chicago Food Inspections  
- **Source:** Public government data (via Kaggle)  
- **Domain:** Public Health / Compliance  

The dataset contains inspection records for food establishments across Chicago and includes missing values, inconsistent text fields, and date formatting issues.

---

## Objectives
The key goals of this notebook are to:
- Understand the structure and quality of the raw data
- Identify missing and inconsistent values
- Clean and standardize categorical columns
- Convert and validate date fields
- Prepare the dataset for reliable analysis

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected the raw dataset
- Analyzed missing values across all columns
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized categorical text fields such as inspection results and facility types
- Parsed inspection dates and extracted year information
- Performed validation checks after cleaning
- Used visualizations to confirm data consistency

---

## Visualizations Included
- Missing values percentage by column  
- Distribution of inspection results after cleaning  
- Annual number of food inspections  

These plots help validate the effectiveness of the data cleaning process and ensure readiness for further analysis.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Key Learnings
- Real-world datasets are often messy and require significant preprocessing
- Data cleaning is a critical step that directly impacts analysis quality
- Visual checks are useful for validating cleaning decisions
- Proper handling of dates and categorical data improves analytical reliability

---

## Next Steps
- Perform exploratory data analysis on inspection outcomes
- Analyze common violations and failure patterns
- Use the cleaned dataset for business or policy-related insights
